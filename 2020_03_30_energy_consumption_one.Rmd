## Agenda

- Background
- Challenges
- Deliverables
- Approach
- Preliminary results
- Recommendations


## Smart Home
- Can be determined as usage of technical systems, automated processes and connected, remote-controlled devices in flats and houses. 
- The essential aim of the functions is to improve the quality of life and convenience in home. 
- Last but not least is greater security and more efficient use of energy

## Challenges

Will smart home owner benefit from submeterings based on:

 - payoff despite installation and maintenance expenses
 - more rational (controlled) energy usage and go-green reputation 

Can smart home buyer take advantage of anonymous selling own data records?

## Suggestions

- Electric power consumption reports in kWatt/hour and â‚¬ terms 
- Detailed energy records based on appliance nature and house location
- Prediction of future electric power usage trends

## Approach 

- Missing values treatment
- Adjustment of proper granularity level
- Predictive modelling
- Intercative dashboards

## Deliverables 

### Commercially viable product

- I   Deep data analysis (January 2011)
- II  Predictive analytics (February 2011)
- III Dashboard software development (April 2011)

### Elaboration

- Development of savings strategies
- Correction of negative houshold behaviour patterns


## Total Energy Consumption
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  pad.table %>%
  select(GAP, Submeter_1, Submeter_2, Submeter_3) %>%
  summary() %>%
  knitr::kable() %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")
  #knitr::kable()

```

## Energy Usage (by month)

## Recommendations
- Gas submeter can be advised for consideration as overall gas consumption can compromise kitchen performance. Depending on cooking preferances (mainly using gas powered hot plates) kitchen data would be biased.
- Eating outside may reduce energy consumption in the kitchen area. Collection of catering bills on monthly basis could facilitate kitchen associated data quality.
